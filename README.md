# Online Multiplayer Card Game - Back end App

## Description

This is my final university project. Is an online multiplayer card game that I am developing using Vue, Typescript, Nest (Node.js + Express), and Tailwind. Currently, the project is in progress and I plan to complete it by the end of May. The game is designed to be played in real-time with other players using web sockets.
